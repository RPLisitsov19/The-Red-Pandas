	    <h3>History</h3>
<p>Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as the game of crosses and circles, is one of the most popular, world-famous games. It is believed that it’s earliest version was played by the population of ancient Egypt, and historical records show that the outlines of it’s playing field were found carved on the walls of a number of temples throughout Rome, as well as on the walls of some medieval, English cathedrals. From antiquity to the present day, Tic-Tac-Toe has been a game that has entertained people for centuries. And while it's more popular today as a child's play, the situation hasn't always looked that way.</p>
<h3>Where did the name come from?</h3>
<p>The word "Tic" is kind of an Americanization. In the 1800s, the game also had the name in England of "Tit-Tat-Toe". A "tit" was another word for a slap. "Tat" meant retribution, such as "going tit-for-tat". "Toe" was the name for a third thing in a row.

So, "Tit-Tat-Toe" was just a name for the three Xs or Os in a row. </p>
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe Today</h3>
<p>Today, Tic-Tac-Toe is played worldwide, albeit not always under the same name. When played in England, it’s generally referred to as “noughts and crosses,” the same name it had when it first appeared on the scene in the 1800s. Different regions in Ireland may switch between the names “X’s and O’s,” “Boxin’ Oxen,” and “X-e O-zees.”  In Norway, it’s called “Twiddles and Bears.” The good news is that it’s pretty much played the same way in every country, so if you find yourself in an airport, drawing up that famous board is a challenge everyone can recognize.</p>
<p>As a comparison to the original terni lapilli, we draw lines to create nine-square grids. With X starting the game, people try to mark the squares with Xs and Os, trying to get those three marks in a row. However, there are a variety of more complex variants out there for those who want to try their luck, including boards with four or five rows, or even taking the game into three dimensions using special boards.</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>A player can play a perfect game of tic-tac-toe (to win or at least draw) if, each time it is their turn to play, they choose the first available move from the following list, as used in Newell and Simon's 1972 tic-tac-toe program.</p>
<ol>
<li>Win: If the player has two in a row, they can place a third to get three in a row.</li> <br>
<li>Block: If the opponent has two in a row, the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.</li><br>
<li>Fork: Create an opportunity where the player has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).</li><br>
<li>Blocking an opponent's fork: If there is only one possible fork for the opponent, the player should block it. Otherwise, the player should block all forks in any way that simultaneously allows them to create two in a row. Otherwise, the player should create a two in a row to force the opponent into defending, as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork. For example, if "X" has two opposite corners and "O" has the center, "O" must not play a corner move in order to win. (Playing a corner move in this scenario creates a fork for "X" to win.)</li><br>
<li>Center: A player marks the center. (If it is the first move of the game, playing a corner move gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes no difference between perfect players.)</li><br>
<li>Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner, the player plays the opposite corner.</li><br>
